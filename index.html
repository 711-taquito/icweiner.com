      <p>
      On a roller grill, they turn and spin,
      In the corner store's warm and welcoming din.
      A symphony of snacks, a savory parade,
      Where cravings are sated, and hunger is swayed.
      </p>
      <p>
      Icy weiners, a curious delight,
      Cold to the touch, but in taste, just right.
      They lie in contrast to the hot dogs near,
      A chilly bite that brings cheer.
      </p>
      <p>
      Taquitos roll, with flavors bold,
      Stories of spices and warmth they unfold.
      Beside them, sausages dance with zeal,
      A carnival of taste that feels surreal.
      </p>
      <p>
      Corn dogs crisp in golden embrace,
      A childhood joy, a familiar taste.
      But ic weiners stand apart,
      A frosty treat, an ic art.
      </p>
      <p>
      In this realm of rollers, dreams are fed,
      From steaming buns to the cold, instead.
      A 7-11 feast, a late-night win,
      Where ic weiners and friends all spin.
